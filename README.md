# Depreciation Methods Calculator

A Python project to compute and visualize annual depreciation and book value of an asset using three different depreciation methods:
1. Straight Line Method
2. Sinking Fund Method
3. Double Declining Balance Method

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project simulates the depreciation of a machine with the following conditions:

- **Initial Cost:** Rp 15,000
- **Salvage Value:** 10% of purchase price (Rp 1,500)
- **Useful Life:** 5 years
- **Interest Rate:** 18%

The results are visualized using matplotlib to compare the depreciation effect over time.

Understanding how different depreciation methods affect the value of assets is crucial in industrial engineering and accounting. This project helps to:

- Calculate depreciation for fixed assets
- Compare methods with different financial assumptions
- Visualize financial performance over asset lifespan

## âœ¨ Features

- Calculates annual depreciation and book value for 5 years
- Generates comparative line plot for straight line, sinking fund and double declining balance methods

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Python(numpy, matplotlib)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Result 

The final output shows a comparative plot of book values:
- Straight Line â†’ Linear drop
- Sinking Fund â†’ Slow start, fast end
- DDB â†’ Fast start, slow end

Each method provides different financial implications for asset management.
