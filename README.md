# Depreciation Methods Calculator

A Python project to compute and visualize annual depreciation and book value of an asset using three different depreciation methods:
1. Straight Line Method
2. Sinking Fund Method
3. Double Declining Balance Method

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates the depreciation of a machine with the following conditions:

- **Initial Cost:** Rp 15,000
- **Salvage Value:** 10% of purchase price (Rp 1,500)
- **Useful Life:** 5 years
- **Interest Rate:** 18%

The results are visualized using Matplotlib to compare the depreciation effect over time.

## 🧩 Problem

Understanding how different depreciation methods affect the value of assets is crucial in industrial engineering and accounting. This project helps to:

- Calculate depreciation for fixed assets
- Compare methods with different financial assumptions
- Visualize financial performance over asset lifespan

---

## ✨ Features

- 📉 Calculates annual depreciation and book value for 5 years
- 📊 Generates comparative line plot for all three methods
- 🔁 Easy to modify for different values or durations
- 📦 Clean and readable Python code

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **NumPy**: numerical calculations
- **Matplotlib**: data visualization

---

## 📈 Result Preview

The final output shows a comparative plot of book values:
- Straight Line → Linear drop
- Sinking Fund → Slow start, fast end
- DDB → Fast start, slow end

Each method provides different financial implications for asset management.
